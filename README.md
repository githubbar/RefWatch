## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   An Android device running Wear OS [Specify minimum Wear OS version, e.g., Wear OS 3.0 (API 30) or higher].
*   Android Studio [Specify version, e.g., Giraffe | 2022.3.1 or newer] to build and install.

### Building and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    Open the cloned project directory in Android Studio.
3.  **Build the project:**
    Let Gradle sync and then build the project (`Build > Make Project`).
4.  **Install on Emulator/Device:**
    *   Connect your Wear OS device or start a Wear OS emulator.
    *   Select the device/emulator from the deployment target dropdown in Android Studio.
    *   Click the "Run 'wear-app'" button (green play icon).

## Technologies Used

*   **Kotlin:** Primary programming language.
*   **Jetpack Compose for Wear OS:** Modern UI toolkit for building native Wear OS interfaces.
*   **Wear OS Material Components:** UI elements designed for Wear OS.
*   **StateFlow & ViewModel:** For reactive state management following MVVM architecture.
*   **HorizontalPager:** For swipeable action screens.
*   **SavedStateHandle:** For persisting game state across process death.
*   **CountDownTimer:** For match timekeeping.
*   **Vibrator API:** For haptic feedback.

## Project Structure (Brief Overview)

*   `data/`: Contains data models (`GameState`, `GameSettings`, `GameEvent`, Enums).
*   `navigation/`: Defines navigation routes (`Screen.kt`) and potentially the `NavHost` setup.
*   `presentation/`: UI-related code.
    *   `components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., `ColorIndicator`, `PagerIndicator`, `ConfirmationDialog`).
    *   `dialogs/`: Dialog composables (e.g., `GameSettingsDialogWithPlayPause`).
    *   `screens/`: Composable functions for each screen of the app (e.g., `PreGameSetupScreen`, `SimplifiedGameScreen`, `HomeTeamActionScreen`).
    *   `theme/`: Theme definitions (`Color.kt`, `Theme.kt`, `Type.kt`).
*   `GameViewModel.kt`: The central ViewModel managing game logic and state.
*   `MainActivity.kt`: The main entry point activit√© for the Wear OS app, hosting the navigation.
